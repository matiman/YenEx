YenEx is an on chain forex that converts USD to ETB using Bridge.

Not fully implemented but should include Crossmint for wallet generation and Bridge to convert between stablecoins.

I have used both of the APIs outside of this app but didnt get enough time to completely integrate them and work together.

This is a tx that converted USDC(SOL) to USDC(Base)
